This example demonstrates the bundle feature and concurrency executing.

To use it, load the "thread1.sdc" file into item 0 of bundle and load the "thread2.sdc" into intem 1 of bundle.

Then, be sure, that both items are compiled and run item 0 (where the "thread1.sdc" is loaded).

Look for the result in the console 0.

If you want to run it again, reset both items and clear console 0.
